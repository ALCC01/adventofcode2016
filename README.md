# Advent Of Code 2016

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent Of Code 2016, a
weird way to count the days to December 25th solving daily programming
challenges.

## Usage

First, clone this repository, then install or link this module:

    $ [sudo] npm link
    # Or
    $ [sudo] npm install -g
    
Then, create a .txt file containing your input (defaults to 
`./input.txt`) and run the program against it:

    # aoc <day> <challenge> [file]
    $ aoc 3 2
    Solving challenge 3.2 from input file ./input.txt
    Solution: 1836
